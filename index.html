        <p1 class="font">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;My name is Zachariah Dellimore, I am a African
            American software developer based in Richmond Virginia.
            I am currently a sophmore at Virginia Commonwealth 
            University where I am majoring in Computer Science 
            and minoring in Math with a GPA of 3.6. I went to high
            school at Western Albemarle High School and graduated with
            an advanced degree, magna cum laude, and with a GPA of 3.6.

            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;During high school I was a part of my schools 
            robotics team. I started as a programmer for my team Cable Management
            but after my first year I became the leader of the team and
            had to manage building, programming, and teaching. Teaching
            my team members how to code was very impactful on me because
            it increased my love of coding as well as my understanding of
            how to code. The leadership experience I gained from that experience 
            has stuck with me and has allowed me to become a better team
            member as well as a better team leader. These skills have
            improved my group projects' efficiency and quality drastically.

            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Outside of school I prefer to spend my time coding 
            projects that interest me. Some projects that I have made
            are a Unix Shell program made in the C programming language,
            an email client for Linix Systems made in the C programming
            language, and most recently, a fully customizable Minesweeper
            game made in C++ using the SFML game development library.
